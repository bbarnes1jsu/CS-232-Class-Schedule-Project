# CS-232-Class-Schedule-Project
I created this program for my CS 232 programming course. This is the first project and our goal is to create a simplified verison of the JSU student registration system. We are tasked with retriving the data from a *tab-delimited* CSV format file that contains the Mathemathics and Computer Science Courses for the Spring 2018 semester.

My task for this project is to implement a system which will allow the user to:

     * Search for specfic courses in the data base by course number, which should return a list of section(s) available for each course.
     * Register for a specfic course and section by entering the corrseponding CRN number. The system should now allow the user to register for classes which conflict with each other.
     * View the trial schedule, in the form of a list of the courses that have been added to the schedule so far.
